First Type_in app is an application that has the function of displaying the message you type in.
It's designed by Android Studio ,following the instruction example. When you type some words in the blank, and click "send" button, it will change to another screen and show the thing you've just typed in.

The second mediaplayer app has three buttons, users can play the music by click on "start" button. By clicking "pause" button,the music will pause, and the button text will change to "continue" which means you can click it and the music keeps going on. By click "stop" button, the music will stop, and then when you click "start" it will start from the beginning. Unfortunately, it can only plays one song which I put into "raw" folder, and the "pause"/"continue" can only use oen time, I'm still working on it.
